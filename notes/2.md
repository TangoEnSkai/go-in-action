# 2. Go quick-start

- comprehensive go program?
- types, variables, funcitons, methods
- goroutines
- generic codes with interfaces
- error handing as normal program logic

one of the purpose of go:

- being able to be productive w/o losing access to the lower-level programmign constructs
- minimum set of
  - keywords
  - built-in functions
  - syntax
- comprehensive standard library
  - mature for real world web and network based programs

- simple program
  - code: [GitHub: chap2 sample](https://github.com/goinaction/code/tree/master/chapter2/sample)
  - how it works:
    - 1. reads text files
    - 2. makes wep calls
    - 3. decodes both XML and JSON into struct type value
    - note: with goroutines

### Project structure for the application

```bash
.
└── sample
    ├── main.go           // Programs entry point
    ├── data
    │   └── data.json     // Contains a list of data feeds
    ├── matchers
    │   └── rss.go        // Matcher for searching rss feeds
    └── search
        ├── default.go    // Default matcher for searching data
        ├── feed.go       // Support for reading the json data file
        ├── match.go      // Interface support for using different matchers
        └── search.go     // Main program logic for performing search
```

- `data` directory: JSON docuemnts of data feeds
- `matchers` directory: ccode for the different types of feeds the program supports
- `search` directory: business logic forf using the different matchers to search content
- `sample` directory: the parent, hold `main` that's the entry point

---

## 2.2. Main package

- the program's entry point: `main.go`

```go
package main

import (
  "log"
  "os"

  _ "github.com/goinaction/code/chapter2/sample/matchers"
  "github.com/goinaction/code/chapter2/sample/search"
)

// init is called prior to main.
func init() {
  // Change the device for logging to stdout.
  log.SetOutput(os.Stdout)
}

// main is the entry point for the program.
func main() {
  // Perform the search for the specified term.
  search.Run("president")
}
```

- go program that produces an executable: two features
  - func `main`: must be declared for build tools, it becomes the entry point
  - package `main`: func `main` located here; if not, the build tools won't produce an executable

- every code file in go belongs to a package (no exception for `main.go`)
- all code files in a directory must use the same package name

```go
import (
  _ "github.com/goinaction/code/chapter2/sample/matchers"

  ...
)
```

- `_` allows initialisation from a package to occur, even if you don't directly use any from the package
- in general, if you don't use any, go complier won't let you declare a package to be imported if it's not used
- we need this for now since:
  - `rss.go` in the `matchers` package contains an `init` function to register the RSS matcher for use

in the package `main`, we have `init` function:

```go
// init is called prior to main.
func init() {
  // Change the device for logging to stdout.
  log.SetOutput(os.Stdout)
}
```

- all `init` functions in any code file that are part of the program:
  - will get called before the main function
  - this `init` sets:
    - logger from the standard library to write to the `stdout` device
    - by default, the loggger is set to write to the `stderr` device

in the `main` function:

```go
// main is the entry point for the program.
func main() {
  // Perform the search for the specified term.
  search.Run("president")
}
```

- we see run `Run` that is imported from package `search`
  - this func has core business logic

---

## 2.3. Search poackage

- search package contains
  - framework
  - business logic
- 4 differnt code files per unique responsiblity

- matcher
  - a value that contains specific intelligence for processing a feed type
  - in our program, we have 2 matchers:
    - framework implements the default matcher
      - no intelligence
    - in the `matchers` package
      - implementation of an RSS matcher
  - later
    - could read: JSON, CSV, ...

### `search.go`

```go
package search

import (
  "log"
  "sync"
)

// A map of registered matchers for searching.
var matchers = make(map[string]Matchers)
```

`matchers` is outside of any functions in this package,
it's package-level variable

- identifier with
  - lower case: unexported from the package
  - Upper Case: exported from the package
- variable initialisation by speical built-in function `make`
  - `var matcher = make(...)`
- making a `map`
  - `map`
    - a reference type that you are required to `make` in golang
    - if we first don't `make` a `map` and assign it to a variable
      - we will get error, when you try to use `map` variable
      - since _zero value_ of `map` is `nil`

#### Zero Values

- in golang variables are initialised as _zero values_
  - numeric types: zero value is `0`
  - for `string`: zero value is empty string, `""`
  - for `bool`: zero value is `false`
  - for pointers: zero value is `nil`
  - variables that declared as a _reference type_ set to their zero value will return the value of `nil`

#### `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` environmental variables:

```bash
GOROOT="/Users/me/go"
GOPATH="/Users/me/spaces/go/projects"
```

- `package log`
  - support for logging messages to the `stdout`, `stderr`, etc.
- `package sync`
  - support for synchronising goroutines

```go
package search

import (
  "log"
  "sync"
)

// A map of registered matchers for searching.
var matchers = make(map[string]Matchers)

// Run performs the serach logic.
func Run(searchTerm string) {
  // Retrieve the list of feeds to search through.
  feeds, err := RetrieveFeeds()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  // Create a unbuffered channel to receive match results.
  results := make(chan *Result)

  // Setup a wait group so we can process all the feeds.
  var waitGroup sync.WaitGroup

  // Set the number of goroutines we need to wait for while
  // they process the individual feeds.
  waitGroup.Add(len(feeds))

  // Launch a goroutine for each feed to find the results.
  for _, feed := range feeds {
    // Retrieve a matcher for the search.
    matcher, exists := matchers[feed.Type]
    if !exists {
      matcher = matchers["default"]
    }

    // Launch the goroutine to preform the search.
    go func(matcher Matcher, feed *Feed) {
      Match(matcher, feed, searchTerm, results)
      waitGroup.Done()
    }(matcher, feed)
  }

  // Launch a goroutine to monitor when all the work is done.
  go func() {
    // Wait for everything to be processed.
    waitGroup.Wait()

    // Close the channel to signal to the Display
    // function that we can exist the program.
    close(results)
  }()

  // Start displaying results as they are available and
  // return after the final result is displayed.
  Display(results)
}
```
