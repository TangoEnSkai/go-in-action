# 2. Go quick-start

- comprehensive go program?
- types, variables, funcitons, methods
- goroutines
- generic codes with interfaces
- error handing as normal program logic

one of the purpose of go:

- being able to be productive w/o losing access to the lower-level programmign constructs
- minimum set of
  - keywords
  - built-in functions
  - syntax
- comprehensive standard library
  - mature for real world web and network based programs

- simple program
  - code: [GitHub: chap2 sample](https://github.com/goinaction/code/tree/master/chapter2/sample)
  - how it works:
    - 1. reads text files
    - 2. makes wep calls
    - 3. decodes both XML and JSON into struct type value
    - note: with goroutines

### Project structure for the application

```bash
.
└── sample
    ├── main.go           // Programs entry point
    ├── data
    │   └── data.json     // Contains a list of data feeds
    ├── matchers
    │   └── rss.go        // Matcher for searching rss feeds
    └── search
        ├── default.go    // Default matcher for searching data
        ├── feed.go       // Support for reading the json data file
        ├── match.go      // Interface support for using different matchers
        └── search.go     // Main program logic for performing search
```

- `data` directory: JSON docuemnts of data feeds
- `matchers` directory: ccode for the different types of feeds the program supports
- `search` directory: business logic forf using the different matchers to search content
- `sample` directory: the parent, hold `main` that's the entry point
