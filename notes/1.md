# 1. Introducing Go

- Go, a programming language
  - makes sharing code easy
  - ships tools easy to use packages written by others
  - we can also easily share our packages

## 1.1. Solving modern programming challenges with Go

- fast execution: c/c++
- rapid development: python, ruby
- both: go

### 1.1.1. Development speed

- longer complile time for c/c++

- go: fast complie time
  - smart compiler
  - simplified dependencyg resoultion algorithms
    - compiler
      - only need to check the libraries that are directly included
      - unlike traversing the dependencies of all the libraries, includeded in the entire dependency chain like C/C++, Java
    - many go projects compiles under a second
    - entire go source tree complies in under 20 seconds on modern machine(s).

- dynamic langagues make you develop fast
  - no intermedicate steps between writing code and executing it
  - trade off:
    - does not offer **type safety**
    - e.g. ID for a programming
      - string?
      - int?
      - UUID?
    - need to check source
  - in go (static type): complier will catch the **type**, type differences
    - static language: type safe

### 1.1.2. Concurrency

### 1.1.3. Go's type system

### 1.1.4. Memory management
