# 1. Introducing Go

- Go, a programming language
  - makes sharing code easy
  - ships tools easy to use packages written by others
  - we can also easily share our packages

## 1.1. Solving modern programming challenges with Go

- fast execution: c/c++
- rapid development: python, ruby
- both: go

### 1.1.1. Development speed

- longer complile time for c/c++

- go: fast complie time
  - smart compiler
  - simplified dependencyg resoultion algorithms
    - compiler
      - only need to check the libraries that are directly included
      - unlike traversing the dependencies of all the libraries, includeded in the entire dependency chain like C/C++, Java
    - many go projects compiles under a second
    - entire go source tree complies in under 20 seconds on modern machine(s).

- dynamic langagues make you develop fast
  - no intermedicate steps between writing code and executing it
  - trade off:
    - does not offer **type safety**
    - e.g. ID for a programming
      - string?
      - int?
      - UUID?
    - need to check source
  - in go (static type): complier will catch the **type**, type differences
    - static language: type safe

### 1.1.2. Concurrency

- modern computer wish many cores
  - but, most programming languages (hereafter PL)
    - no tools for utilising the resources (multicores)
    - often requires a lot of thread synchronisation codes
      - prone to error

- go
  - concurrency
  - goroutines
    - like threads
      - far less memory
      - require less code to use
  - channels
    - are data structure
      - you send typed messages between/amongst goroutines with synchronisation built in
    - facilitates a programming model
      - you send data between goroutines
      - rather than letting the goroutines **fight** to use same data.

#### Goroutines

- goroutines
  - are function
  - run concurrently with other goroutines, incl. entry point of your program
    - other language use threads to achieve same goals
    - in go, many goroutines execute on a **single thread**
      - e.g. a web server
        - handling different web requests simultaneously
          - in c/java, have to write a lot of extra code
          - in go, `net/http` library w/ concurrency built in (by utilising goroutines)
            - each inbound req, automatically runs on its "own" goroutine
  - use less memory than threads
  - "go runtime"
    - automatically schedule the execution of goroutines
    - against a set of configured logical processors
      - each logical processor
        - is bound to a single OS thread
    - reduces development effort

example:

```go
func log(msg string) {
  ... some logging code here
}

// Elsewhere in our code after we've discovered an error.
go log("someting dire happened")
```

- `go` keyword
  - all you need to schedule the `log` function to run a goroutine
    - the goroutine will run concurrently with other goroutines
    - you can continously execute the rest of your code (whilst the logging is executing, concurrently)
- goroutine has minimal overhead
- common to spawn tens of thousands of them

#### Channels

- channles
  - are data structures
  - enable safe data communication between goroutines
  - help you to avoid problems typically seen with shared memory access in various PLs.

- challenge of concurrecy
  - data is NOT unexpectedly modified by concurrently running processes
    - e.g. multiple threads handle same data w/o **locks**, **synchronisation**: heartache
  - other conventional PLs on global variables w/ shard memory
    - need complicated locking disciplines to avoid unsynchronised changes on the same data/variables
      - go's channel resovles this problem
      - by providing "pattern"
        - the pattern makes data safe from _concurrent modification_
        - channel enforce the pattern: only one goroutine should modify the data at any time

- channel do NOT provide data access protection between goroutines
  - copies of data exchanged through goroutines, then
  - each of goroutine: has its own copy
  - they make changes with their own copy
  - thus, any changes to that data: safe 
    - (this means not modifiying shared one data, since each goroutine handle their own copy, that's not affecting the original data directly in real time)
  - pointers?
    - when they are being exchanged via a channel
    - each goroutine still need to be synchronized
      - if reads/writes will be performed by different goroutines

### 1.1.3. Go's type system

- go: flexible hierarchy-free type system
  - enable code reuse w/ minimal refactoring overhead
  - still object-oriented development
    - w/o conventional headache
      - go's one is simpler than traditional Java/C++ abstract classes and interfaces

- go developers: simply embed types to reuse funcitonality in design pattern [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern)
  - other PLs use composition, but deeply tied to "inheritance"
    - interitance: complicated and hard to use
  
- go types: composed of smaller types
  - in contrast to conventional inheritance-based models
  - unique interface implementation
    - you can model behaviours, rather than model types
    - means you do not have to declare that you are implementing an interface in go
      - complier: determines whether values of your types satisfy the inferface you are using or not

- interfaces in go's standard library
  - small
  - exposing few functions
